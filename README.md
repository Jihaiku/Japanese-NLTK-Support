# Japanese-NLTK-Support
An ongoing project to make the Japanese language usable with NLTK library functions.

This project is two python files that are used together to create what is shown below. 

  - Part 1: Final Jisho Scraper
    - Comprises of the Web Scraper and the EDA and visualization for the project
    
  - Part 2: Final NLTK Support
    - Creates the functions that will assist in conditioning data to be compatible with NLTK
    
# Abstract
What this program is meant to address are the parts of the NLTK library that do not work well with Japanese text and turn them into data that can be easily used within that library. 

The program is also going to attempt to make it so that the reader/user of this does not need to be familiar with Japanese beyond the short exerpts that I provide throughout the Jupyter Notebook. While I would always recommend familiarizing yourself with the language to some extent ahead of time, I find making this as accessible as possible one of my end goals.

Below I will have listed what the project currently has completed to some degree and what are the working goals in the future. While I do have a working understanding of the language through nearly a decade of study, I am by no means a linguist, an expert translator, or know fluent Japanese. If you find an error or a better way of doing something that is shown below then by all means submit a change request and I hope that we both come out learning more from it.

## Currently Completed Goals
    - Pre-language processing
    - Basic sentence processing
    - Basic Stemming / Lemmatization
    - Particle recognition
    - Word/Character lookup and reverse lookup
    - Basic Parts of Speech Tagging
    - Basic Tokenization

## Pending Goals
    - Including more particles
    - Including complex Stemming / Lemmatization
    - Complex sentence processing
    - Stop Word inclusion
    - NER/NED inclusion
    - Better Parts of Speech Tagging
